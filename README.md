# Univariate-and-Multivariate-Linear-Regression-from-scratch-in-Tensorflow
Univariate Linear regression is done on Toy Dataset while multivariate Linear Regression is done using https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data as the data. Here the MPG is the target.
